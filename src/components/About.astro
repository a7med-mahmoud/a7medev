        My name is Ahmed Mahmoud, I'm a JavaScript developer living in Egypt.
        I have an endless passion towards programming, especially web, mobile
        development and everything JavaScript.
        Developing front-end apps with React.js, mobile apps with React Native,
        and back-ends with Node.js, and that's what gives me superpowers!
        I care a lot about design, accessibility, performance,
        and security. And always trying to improve my skills and knowledge, so I'm always
        looking for new challenges. I'm constantly learning new things, not just about
        programming, sometimes itâ€™s Maths or Sciences. I'm always looking for
        oppertunities to learn new things, and aiming to work with kind and talented
        people to share the knowledge with and learn from.
